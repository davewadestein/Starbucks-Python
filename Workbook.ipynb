    "  * we can inspect them, we can find them in memory\n",
    "  * objects consist of multiple parts\n",
    "* it's a terrible language for numerics\n",
    "  * 1991...Python's raison d'être was for manipulating data in the form of text/files/etc.\n",
    "  * Python has a lot of support for text/data manipulation as a result\n",
    "* two kinds of variables: scalars and containers\n",
    "  * scalar = a single value, e.g., int, float, bool\n",
    "  * container = an object which contains or has in it 0+ other objects\n",
    "    * e.g., str, list\n",
    "* built-in functions are general, in that they typically can take lots of different kinds of arguments\n",
    "  * e.g., __`print()`__, __`str()`__\n",
    "  * called in the \"standard way\", i.e., __`name()`__\n",
    "* datatype-specific functions (also called \"methods\") are called with a different notation\n",
    "  * __`object.func()`__, where object is an object of that datatype\n",
    "* builtin functions DO NOT change the objects that are passed into them...\n",
    "   * e.g., str(var) does not change var in any way, shape, or form\n",
    "   * instead it returns a string version of var\n",
    "* if you want to change an object in Python, you must apply/invoke/call a method on it\n",
    "   * not all methods change the objects that are applied/invoked/call upon/to\n",
    "* Python has mutable and immutable containers:\n",
    "  * immutable: str\n",
    "  * mutable: list"
